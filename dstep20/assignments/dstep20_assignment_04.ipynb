Your team is large and consists of groups that study building characteristics and energy consumption as well as groups that study population predictions and growth estimates.  Taken together, they can create a model for future population growth and infrastructure, but they are missing a key piece of the puzzle: how usage characteristics of the population scales with social and economic factors.  The hypothesis is that there may be link between the two given the link between [energy consumption per person and GDP per capita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-use-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita) on a global scale.\n","\n","**The Problem Statement:** Your job is to explore the economic and social dimension of the problem by combining recently released energy consumption data in Chicago with data from the Census on population characteristics by Census Tract <small>(note, the consumption data exists at the census block level, but being well versed in the census, you know that census block estimates have significant uncertainty, and so the decision is made to focus on the Census Tract level)</small>.  As with the last assignment, **the deliverable for this assignment is a complete, end-to-end data science workflow similar to those we've seen before, including 1) Background information on the problem and data sets, 2) Data description and summary, 3) Analysis and visualizations, and 4) Summary of findings.**\n","\n","**Useful Data Sets:**  Data sets to be used for this task include the [Energy Usage Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Energy-Usage-2010/8yq3-m6wp), the [Census Tract shapes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Census-Tracts-2010/5jrd-6zik) in Chicago, and the [2010 Census Data at American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"889lTqgtfE3n","colab_type":"text"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mUiwvcsDdWsT","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
