The satellite measurements are primarily accomplished by firing radio waves towards the ocean surface and waiting for the time it takes for those radio waves to bounce back and return to the satellite.  Since we know how fast light (radio waves are a form of light) travels, the distance from the satellite to the surface is just the bounce back time divided by the speed of light.  [TOPEX/Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPEX/Poseidon) has been one of the most successful satellite missions for these altimetry measurements of the ocean surface.  [Tide gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_gauge), on the other hand, are ground-based measurements that directly measure the height of water relative to a stationary device.  They are less accurate, provide significantly reduced spatial and temporal coverage, but prior to satellite altimetry, were the only real method for measuring sea level. \n","\n","There are three main goals of this assignment:\n","\n","1. accessing and working with a century of sea level data\n","2. fitting linear models to that data for estimates of the rate of sea level rise\n","3. comparing multiple models for prediction of future sea level\n","\n","<u>**Instructions for tasks that will be graded are in bold below.**</u>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G177z_yI72CE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### PART 1 - Background\n","\n","Good data science (and data analysis more generally) depends on a clear understanding of the underlying problem/situation, the methods by which the data you are about to analyze are collected, and the situational context in which that data sits.
