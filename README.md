### Course Description
>As societal data has become increasingly ubiquitous and accessible, there has been a rapid growth in the opportunity to utilize evidence-based decision making in public policy for a variety of tasks including planning, performance evaluation, and comparative analysis. At the same time, the recently established field of Data Science is focused on developing methods and tools to extract insight, understanding, and evidence from diverse and often large data sets. This course will introduce students to those tools and techniques for working with data in the context of evidenced-based policy, focusing on how data is accessed, handled, analyzed, and visualized.

Topics covered will include: an introduction to Python, R, and Data Science; accessing and working with policy-relevant data; data structures (including geospatial information); basic statistics and analysis; and data visualization.

### Course Goals
This course will:
 * provide an overview of data science (DS) concepts that are important for evidence-based
decision making in public policy including inferential reasoning with data,
 * introduce students to a set of tools for acquiring and analyzing public/private/academic data
that can be used to assess the impacts of policy decisions and guide policy design,
 * present topics that are foundationally important to data use in society such as the open data
and open source ethos, reproducibility, (un)certainty, and bias.

Upon successful completion the student will be able to:
 * access, analyze, and visualize policy-relevant data in a variety of formats from a broad
range of sources using DS methods,
 * effectively use software tools such as Python and R to apply DS techniques to real-world
problems,
 * present the results of policy-focused, data-driven analysis through data visualizations.


### Course Format
For most weeks, the Monday session will consist of a lecture-style introduction of new tools and
techniques from DS and will introduce an example application of those to a data problem that is
related to evidence-based policy and decision making. The Wednesday and Friday sessions will
be hands-on, focused on accessing and working with the data for that application (Wednesday)
and analysis, interpretation, and visualization (Friday) with DS methods. All sessions will be
interactive and students should bring an internet-connected device on which it is easy to type;
i.e., a laptop (recommended) or tablet+keyboard. Throughout the course, students will be
directly analyzing and applying DS methods to data using the Python language (expertise or
previous exposure to Python is ​ **not** ​ required).

### Recommended Prerequisites
UAPP 691 or equivalent; basic statistics; experience working with data through an analysis
platform (Python, R, STATA, SAS, SPSS, etc).

### Recommended Materials
There will be no textbook, slides and handouts from class will constitute the bulk of the material.
Reading will be assigned every lecture from relevant articles and papers.

### Course and UD Policies
_Attendance_  
Absences on religious holidays listed in university calendars is recognized as an excused
absence. Nevertheless, students are urged to remind the instructor of their intention to be absent
on a particular upcoming holiday. Absences on religious holidays not listed in university
calendars, as well as absences due to athletic participation or other extracurricular activities in
which students are official representatives of the university, shall be recognized as excused
absences when the student informs the instructor in writing during the first two weeks of the
semester of these planned absences for the semester.

_Academic Integrity_  
Please familiarize yourself with UD policies regarding academic dishonesty. To falsify the
results of one's research, to steal the words or ideas of another, to cheat on an assignment, to
re-submit the same assignment for different classes, or to allow or assist another to commit these
acts corrupts the educational process. Students are expected to do their own work and neither
give nor receive unauthorized assistance. Complete details of the university's academic integrity
policies and procedures can be found at [http://www1.udel.edu/studentconduct/policyref.html](http://www1.udel.edu/studentconduct/policyref.html)
